# ðŸŸ¢ Day 26 of My Verilog Coding Streak

## ðŸ§  Topic: JK Flip-Flop (Edge-Triggered)
ðŸ”§ Tool Used: Cadence Xcelium on EDA Playground  

---

## ðŸ“Œ What I did
- Designed a JK Flip-Flop in Verilog with inputs `J`, `K`, `clk`, `rst` and output `Q`.  
- Created a testbench to validate **Set, Reset, Hold, and Toggle** operations.  
- Generated waveform (`jk_ff.vcd`) and verified edge-triggered behavior.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Highlight
The JK Flip-Flop extends the SR functionality and avoids the invalid state:  

- `J=0, K=0 â†’ Hold`  
- `J=0, K=1 â†’ Reset (Q=0)`  
- `J=1, K=0 â†’ Set (Q=1)`  
- `J=1, K=1 â†’ Toggle (Q = ~Q)`  

This makes it one of the most widely used sequential elements.

## ðŸ“Š Observation
- Correct **edge-triggered** response observed in simulation.  
- **Toggle behavior** clearly visible when `J=K=1`.
