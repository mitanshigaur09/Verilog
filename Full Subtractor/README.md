# Day 16 â€“ Full Subtractor Design Using Basic Logic Gates

## ðŸ§  Topic
Full Subtractor Design Using Basic Logic Gates

## ðŸ”§ Tool Used
Cadence Xcelium on EDA Playground

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did
- Designed the `diff` (difference) output using XOR operations  
- Generated the `borr` (borrow) output using AND, OR, and NOT gates  
- Created a testbench to verify all 8 input combinations  
- Validated the results via simulation log and waveform  

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Highlight
The Full Subtractor determines the difference of two bits with a borrow-in, producing both a difference and borrow-out.  
Itâ€™s a critical component in arithmetic logic for subtraction operations in processors.

## ðŸ“Š Observation
- `diff` is **1** when the number of high inputs among `a`, `b`, and `bin` is odd  
- `borr` is **1** when the subtraction requires borrowing from the next higher bit  

The waveform and simulation log perfectly matched the theoretical truth table.
