# Day 28 â€“ D Flip-Flop

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

The **D Flip-Flop** (Data or Delay Flip-Flop) is the most widely used flip-flop in digital systems.
It captures the input `D` on the **rising edge** of the clock and holds it until the next clock edge.
With a reset, it initializes the circuit to a known state.

## ðŸ“Š Simulation

* **Reset (`rst=1`)** â†’ Output `Q` is cleared to `0`.
* **On rising clock edge with `rst=0`** â†’ `Q` follows input `D`.
* **Between clock edges** â†’ `Q` holds its value.

## âœ… Observation

* Verified **edge-triggered behavior** of the D Flip-Flop.
* Reset operation worked as expected.
* Output updated only on clockâ€™s rising edge and remained stable otherwise.
