### 🔧 Verilog Coding Streak – Daily HDL Practice

This repository contains my **daily Verilog practice codes** as part of a personal streak focused on strengthening my **RTL design and simulation skills**.

Each day includes:

* ✅ A Verilog module (combinational or sequential)
* 🧪 A corresponding testbench
* 📊 Simulation waveforms and results (if applicable)
* 📁 Organized folders by topic or day

🔍 Topics will include:

* Logic gates
* Multiplexers & Demultiplexers
* Encoders & Decoders
* Flip-flops, Counters
* Finite State Machines (FSMs)
* Timing analysis & waveform debugging

🛠 Simulated using **EDA Playground (Cadence Xcelium 23.09)**.
