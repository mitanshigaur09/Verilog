# Day 7 – OR Gate using NAND Gates (Verilog)

This repository is part of my **#VerilogCodingStreak**, where I implement and simulate various digital logic modules every day. On **Day 7**, I explored gate-level design by implementing a **2-input OR gate using only NAND gates**, demonstrating the universality of NAND gates.

## 🔧 Toolchain Used

- **Simulator**: Cadence Xcelium 23.09
- **Platform**: EDA Playground
- **Language**: Verilog HDL

---

## 📌 What This Includes

- OR gate implementation using only NAND gates.
- A complete testbench for functional simulation.
- VCD waveform file for timing and logic verification.
- Screenshot of waveform output.

---

## ✅ Observations

- The output is HIGH if either input is HIGH.
- Simulation results match the expected truth table.
- Successfully validated the OR logic using only NAND gates.
