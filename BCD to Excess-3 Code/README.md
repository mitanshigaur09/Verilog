## ðŸŸ¢ Day 19: BCD to Excess-3 Code Converter Using Dataflow Modeling  

### ðŸ§  Topic  
BCD to Excess-3 Code Converter Using Dataflow Modeling  

### ðŸ”§ Tool Used  
Cadence Xcelium on EDA Playground  

### ðŸ“Œ What I did  
- Designed the Excess-3 code by adding `0011` (decimal 3) to the BCD input using `assign`  
- Implemented a testbench to apply multiple BCD values  
- Generated waveform (`dump.vcd`) for verification  
- Verified correctness of Excess-3 outputs for valid BCD inputs (0000â€“0011 in this test)  

### ðŸ’¡ Learning Highlight  
The **Excess-3 code** is a **self-complementing code** derived by adding `3` to a given BCD input.  
It is widely used in **arithmetic circuits, error detection, and digital systems** for simplifying complement operations.  

### ðŸ“Š Observation  
- `BCD = 0000 (0)` â†’ `Excess-3 = 0011 (3)`  
- `BCD = 0001 (1)` â†’ `Excess-3 = 0100 (4)`  
- `BCD = 0010 (2)` â†’ `Excess-3 = 0101 (5)`  
- `BCD = 0011 (3)` â†’ `Excess-3 = 0110 (6)`  

The waveform matched the expected conversion accurately.
