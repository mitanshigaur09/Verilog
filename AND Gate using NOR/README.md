# Verilog Coding Streak 💻 – Day 12

## ✅ Project Title: AND Gate Using Only NOR Gates

### 🔍 Objective
To implement a basic **AND gate** by using **only NOR gates**, demonstrating the concept of universal gate logic design in Verilog.

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Simulator**: Cadence Xcelium 23.09
- **Platform**: EDA Playground

### 🧪 What’s Covered
- Utilisation of NOR gates to build an AND gate.
- Full verification using testbench stimulus.
- Simulation log observation and waveform analysis.

### 📌 Key Outcomes
- The output matches the expected logic behaviour of an AND gate.
- Validated using both simulation output and waveform visualisation.
