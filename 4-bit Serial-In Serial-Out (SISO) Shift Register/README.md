# Day 29 â€“ 4-bit Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) Shift Register

## ðŸŸ¢ Overview

On **Day 29** of my Verilog coding streak, I designed and simulated a **4-bit Serial-In Serial-Out (SISO) Shift Register**. This sequential circuit shifts input data serially through flip-flops, producing a delayed output after 4 clock cycles.

## ðŸ§  Topic

**4-bit SISO Shift Register** â€“ fundamental in **serial communication** and **data storage**.

## ðŸ”§ Tool Used

* **Cadence Xcelium**
* **EDA Playground**

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did

* Designed a 4-bit shift register with **serial input** and **serial output**.
* Developed a **testbench** to validate shifting operation with multiple input sequences.
* Generated **waveforms (`siso_shift.vcd`)** and simulation logs to verify correctness.
* Observed **data propagation** across flip-flops over clock cycles.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Highlight

A SISO shift register moves data **one bit at a time** with each clock edge. Itâ€™s a basic yet essential sequential circuit used in digital systems, especially for **serial data transfer**.

## ðŸ“Š Observation

Simulation results confirmed correct shifting behavior:

* Input bits moved sequentially through all flip-flops.
* After 4 clock cycles, the **first input appeared at the serial output**.
