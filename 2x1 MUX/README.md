## ðŸŸ¢ Day 17 â€” 2:1 Multiplexer Design (Dataflow Modeling)

**ðŸ§  Topic:** 2:1 Multiplexer Design Using Dataflow Modeling  
**ðŸ”§ Tool Used:** Cadence Xcelium on EDA Playground  

### ðŸ“Œ What I did
- Designed the MUX output using `assign` statement for dataflow modeling
- Implemented a testbench to check all input combinations
- Generated `dump.vcd` file to visualize the waveform
- Verified correct output switching behavior based on the select line

### ðŸ’¡ Learning Highlight
A **2:1 Multiplexer** routes one of two input signals to the output, depending on the select line (`s`).  
- When `s = 0`, `y = i0`  
- When `s = 1`, `y = i1`  
This is a key building block for larger multiplexers and control logic.

### ðŸ“Š Observation
- The waveform output matched the truth table perfectly
- No glitches or unexpected transitions were observed during switching
