# ðŸŸ¢ Day 32: 4-bit Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO) Shift Register  

## ðŸ“– Overview  
On **Day 32** of my **#Verilog Coding Streak**, I implemented and verified a **4-bit Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO) Shift Register** in Verilog.  
Unlike **SIPO (Serial-In Parallel-Out)** or **PISO (Parallel-In Serial-Out)** registers, this circuit loads and outputs data entirely in **parallel**, making it the simplest form of shift register.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used  
- **Simulator:** Cadence Xcelium  
- **Platform:** [EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com/x/r3ue)  

---

## ðŸ“Œ What I Did  
- âœ… Designed a **4-bit PIPO shift register** with parallel load and parallel output  
- âœ… Built a **testbench** to validate correct loading of data  
- âœ… Generated **waveform (`pipo.vcd`)** and **simulation logs**  
- âœ… Verified immediate transfer of input data to outputs on load  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learning  
- PIPO shift registers are useful when **bulk data transfer** is needed without serialization.  
- They provide the **fastest data movement**, since all bits are loaded and read simultaneously.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Observations  
- Data was loaded in **parallel** within **one clock cycle**.  
- Output immediately reflected the input pattern (`1101` in this case âœ…).  
- **No sequential shifting** was required (unlike SIPO or PISO).
